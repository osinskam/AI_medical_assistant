### **Project Description**

In this project an object detection is performed, with a model which uses textual information to identify relevant elements in images.

**Context:**
A staff member (e.g., a human nurse or triage assistant) is conducting initial patient intake at a clinic. As part of this process, the staff member interviews each arriving patient and takes handwritten notes, including details such as personalia, symptoms, background information, required diagnostics. These notes are recorded on a medical_note.png file.

After the triage process, the patients move to a waiting area, shown in **`hospital_waiting_room.png`**, where multiple people are present, including patients, visitors etc.

We develope a code for a hypothetical reception steward robot. This robot is responsible for reading the triage notes and correctly identifying the patient in the waiting room who matches the description.
